# Machine Learning Classifiers, Dimensionality Reduction and Applications in Satellite Imagery

In this work, we evaluate the performance of different classification
strategies to determine the crop type of a set of pixels in a multiband spectral image.
Such spectral image was taken by sensor type AVIRIS (Airborne Visible / Infrared
Imaging Spectrometer) on board a satellite and it covers a region of Indiana, United
States.
Along this work, we use different machine learning strategies,
including some "state-of-art" tools, such as, K-nearest Neighbours, Support Vector
Machines (SVM) and Random Forests (RF). For the experimental implementation,
students will have to pay special attention to the use of cross validation technique, so
that the free parameter adjustment is exclusively carried out with the data available for
training.
