# Machine Learning Classifiers, Dimensionality Reduction and Applications in Satellite Imagery

In this work, we evaluate the performance of different classification
strategies to determine the crop type of a set of pixels in a multiband spectral image.
Such spectral image was taken by sensor type AVIRIS (Airborne Visible / Infrared
Imaging Spectrometer) on board a satellite and it covers a region of Indiana, United
States.


First, in terms of linear classifiers, the performance of the linear Support
Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) algorithms
are studied. After that, non-linear classifiers such as K-Nearest Neighbours (K-NN), polynomial
and gaussian SVM, and Binary Decision Tree are analyzed. Finally, ensemble classifiers
such as Bagging, including Random Forest (RF), and Boosting are studied. In order to determine the optimal parameters of these
classifiers, the cross-validation process is used.

On the feature extraction side, several linear, non-linear, supervised and non-supervised feature extraction techniques are used. First, in terms of linear
multivariate analysis methods, the performance of the Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Partial Least Squares
(PLS), Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA), and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) algorithms
are studied. After that, non-linear feature extraction techniques based on kernel methods such as
Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA), Kernel Partial Least Squares (KPLS), and Kernel
Canonical Correlation Analysis (KCCA) are analyzed.
