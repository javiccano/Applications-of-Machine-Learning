# Machine Learning Classifiers, Dimensionality Reduction and Applications in Satellite Imagery

In this work, we evaluate the performance of different classification
strategies to determine the crop type of a set of pixels in a multiband spectral image.
Such spectral image was taken by sensor type AVIRIS (Airborne Visible / Infrared
Imaging Spectrometer) on board a satellite and it covers a region of Indiana, United
States.

Along this work, we use different machine learning strategies,
including k-Nearest Neighbours (k-NN), Support Vector
Machines (SVMs), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Decision Trees, and ensemble methods such as boosting and bagging, including Random Forests (RF).
